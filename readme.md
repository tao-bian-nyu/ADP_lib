ADPlib - A C++ library supporting the implementation of various ADP algorithms for users and developers from different background.
------------------------------------------------

This library contains numerical adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms to solve linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems and algebraic Riccati equations (ARE). ADP aims at finding a stabilizing optimal control policy for dynamical systems via online learning. The aim of this project is to provide a complete implementation for online and offline ADP solvers that can be easily applied in the controller design for dynamical systems.
